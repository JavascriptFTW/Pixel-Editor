# Pixel Editor

## About

This project is an online pixel art editor made using React and JSX with the goal of simplifying my own game development workflow and hopefully those of others as well. This project was also begun as a way for me to learn one of the top web frameworks around and make an decently large app. The Flux architecture has been used extensively in this project and has proven to lend itself very well to my requirements.
